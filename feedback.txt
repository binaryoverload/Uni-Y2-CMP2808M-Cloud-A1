C2: 
Your templates files demonstrate innovative and excellent underpinning knowledge of advanced infrastructure-as-code approaches using well-informed deployment manager techniques.
All aspects of the code design, implementation, and deployment process are applied using appropriately scoped cloud services.
Reusability and customisation of templates is evidenced throughout, including data passing and best practice use of variables.
Schema files are also evidenced to a good and meaningful standard and used throughout the majority of service deployments.
A well-informed range of regional and multi-regional cloud PaaS and IaaS services have been deployed to an excellent standard that demonstrates strong conceptual understanding of cloud service concepts.
Verbose code commenting is present. 
Well done on achieving this very high standard of work!

This is an excellent submission that goes well beyond the workshop materials and demonstrates a deep understanding of the more advanced concepts of deploying cloud service infrastructure. 
The use of combining instance groups, load balancers, and VPNs is particularly challenging to configure correctly - well done!
